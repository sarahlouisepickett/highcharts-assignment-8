    <h1>Test and check: A first chart with Highcharts</h1>

    <!-- this container div will hold one chart
         it is empty now - JavaScript will write into it when the page loads -->
    <div id="container"></div>


    <p>This is an example of a simple chart embedded in a Web page. The chart data came from Highcharts: <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/your-first-chart" target="_blank">Your First Chart</a>. The Highcharts Basic Bar Chart
        demo is <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/demo/bar-basic" target="_blank">here</a> &mdash; it uses the latest version of the JavaScript code. Note that the chart's <em>bars become thicker</em> if you add <code>height</code> to the CSS for your
        container DIV.</p>

    <p>Charts are usually placed somewhere in the middle of an article for which the chart provides additional information. Most numerical data is easier for the reader to understand when it appears in chart form. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-of-graphs-for-data-visualization"
        target="_blank">Choosing the best chart type</a> to suit your data is very important when you want to communicate the information effectively.</p>

    <p>I had better not see these paragraphs in your <em>first_chart.html</em>!! This is the <em>test_check.html</em> page.</p>
