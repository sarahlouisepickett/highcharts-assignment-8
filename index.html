<h1>U.S Foreign Aid Spending</h1>
<p><em>By Sarah L. Pickett</em></p>
<p> The United States has been tracking U.S. aid spending since 1946. This chart looks at total obligations from the data from 2010 to 2017. Obligations refer to money that will be disbursed. In 2017, the amount was lower than in 2016.

<p> The U.S Aid Explorer also divides spending up by sector and then by implementing agency, which means the agency that spends the money. This second chart shows how the $49 billion of foreign aid was spent by sector in 2017. The sector with the most spending in 2017 was Conflict, Peace and Security.</p>
